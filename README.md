# One project a day until I land the job 
## Repo is Paused
This repo has been paused as it is not ideal to keep all projects in a single repository. I am still working on projects daily, but in separate repositories.

## About This Repo
- Each folder represents a specific day, with its own self-contained project.
- Projects cover a range of technologies, languages, and topics, reflecting my interests and dedication to learning.
- The goal: Consistency, growth, and showcasing my skills to prospective employers and collaborators.

### Why?

Finding a new job is a journey, and I believe that learning by doing is the best way to improve. By completing a project daily, I’m actively sharpening my abilities and building a robust portfolio.
